Continuous CSS sandbox for personal exploration using CSS transitions, animations, and JavaScript

##Description
This is an ongoing CSS "sandbox" project where I have been working on applying different transition and animation effects to CSS elements. This site is sort of a sketchbook for me to practice new ideas in, and work out how I think inspirational designs I have seen across the web were implemented.
